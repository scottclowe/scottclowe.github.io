## MATLAB Schemer

Colour scheme manager for MATLAB. Import colour schemes, or create your own theme and easily share it with others. Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottclowe/matlab-schemer), mirrored on [FileExchange](http://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/53862-matlab-schemer).


## Colorlab

Perceptually uniform colormaps for MATLAB. Source on [GitHub](https://github.com/scottclowe/colorlab). Project was shelved after [MATLAB 2014b](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/release-notes.html#R2014b) introduced a major graphics overhaul and the [default colormap changed](http://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2014/10/13/a-new-colormap-for-matlab-part-1-introduction/) from `jet` to `parula`, which was an enormous improvement in the perceptual accuracy of the plots created.
