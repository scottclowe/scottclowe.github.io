Hello World!

My name is Scott C. Lowe.

I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), based at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca/), Halifax, Nova Scotia Canada.

I [completed my PhD]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-30-phd-completion %})
 in neuroinformatics at the [Doctoral Training Centre in Computational Neuroscience and Neuroinformatics](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc/) within the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/neuroscience).

My current research focus involves taking inspiration from neuroscience to develop new machine learning techniques and advance artificial intelligence.

My undergraduate studies were in Mathematics and Physics, and I still have a keen interest in both of these subjects.

However, on this blog I expect I will mostly be posting details about my [open source coding projects](https://github.com/scottclowe).

For more details about my qualifications and experience, read my [curriculum vitae](../cv.pdf).
